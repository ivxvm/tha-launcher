        text: "This project started as an experiment on doing a game in Blender directly by the means of UPBGE (continuation of BGE = Blender Game Engine).\n\nWhat I like about UPBGE most is how fast it allows me to iterate on ideas. Being built into Blender directly it's ideal for rapid prototyping, making it easy to test and refine gameplay and designs together and test it all immediately.\n\nOn the other hand, my initial hopes were that sticking to very minimalist lowpoly unshaded style will allow to do fairly complex scenes with very high FPS (100+). It all seemed to work fine at the beginning, but eventually it turned out that real performance bottlenecks were hidden somewhere I never knew existed - in a thing called DepsGraph, which was introduced into Blender together with Eevee render engine.\n\nBasically, the problem with it is that performance gradually drops with increase of number of objects in the scene. When it's possible to merge objects together into a single one - great - it helps, but when they are moving, rotating or have physics, it's not possible. In this game there are moving things, rotating things, a lot of animated individual pickups and more - all leading to high DepsGraph load.\n\nUPBGE is fun and productive to use, especially with the ability to simply press P and play directly inside Blender. While its current limitations can be challenging for larger projects, it remains a great tool for smaller games or prototypes. If you want to use it, the first thing I'd recommend to optimize is the number of objects in scenes.";
