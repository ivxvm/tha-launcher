        text: "This project started as an experiment on doing a game in Blender directly by the means of UPBGE (continuation of BGE = Blender Game Engine).\n\nWhat I like about UPBGE most is how fast it allows to iterate on ideas. Being integrated into Blender directly is ideal for rapid prototyping, making it easy to test and refine gameplay and designs together.\n\nOn the other hand, my initial hopes were that sticking to a minimalist lowpoly unshaded style would allow me to do fairly complex scenes with very high FPS. It all seemed to work fine at the beginning, but eventually, it turned out that real performance bottlenecks were hidden somewhere I never knew existed - in a thing called DepsGraph, which was introduced into Blender together with the Eevee render engine.\n\nBasically, the problem with it is that performance gradually drops with the increase in the number of objects in the scene. When it's possible to merge objects together into a single one - great - it helps, but when they are moving, rotating, or have physics, it's not possible. In this game, there are moving things, rotating things, a lot of animated individual pickups, and more - all leading to high DepsGraph load.\n\nAnyway, UPBGE is fun and productive to use and \"press P to play\" is awesome. In projects where I could be sure the scenes are going to be either tiny or almost completely static, I'd be happy to use it again.";
